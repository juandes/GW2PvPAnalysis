# PvP in Guild Wars 2: A data analysis

## Overview

The game Guild Wars 2, release on 2012, introduces a player versus player (PvP)
game mode called Conquest. In Conquest, there are two teams made of five players,
and the main objective is to seize capture points to increase your team score
(the more points you have, the faster the score increases); other ways to increase
the score if by killing players of the opposing team, non-player characters (NPC)
or by getting special bonuses.

This work is a data analysis done on a dataset made of 119 Conquest matches. In
the analysis we will take a look at several factors regarding a Conquest match,
such as the map where the match was played, the final score of both teams, the result
of the match and the composition of the teams.

The analysis was done using R.

- On the original dataset and the df data frame that you will find in R,
there is a column named winner. If the value of the column is  0, that 
means the red team won the match, otherwise, if winner = 1, then the blue
team won the match.
winner -> 0 if red team wins, 
winner -> 1 if blue team wins.

- Professions: Once the original dataset is loaded into R, the professions
are mapped to some integers. These are the values: 
 
No player -> 0
Elementalist -> 1
Engineer ->	2
Guardian ->	3
Mesmer -> 4
Necromancer -> 5
Ranger -> 6
Thief -> 7
Warrior	-> 8

- Maps: The maps are also mapped to integers:

Battle of Kyhlo	-> 1
Forest of Niflhel -> 2
Legacy of the Foefire -> 3

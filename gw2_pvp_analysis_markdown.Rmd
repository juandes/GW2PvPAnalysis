##Introduction

##Codebook and dataset
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
require(reshape2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/Development/R/GW2PvPAnalysis")
df <- read.csv("~/Development/R/GW2PvPAnalysis/GW2_PvP_data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df$X <- NULL
df$X.1 <- NULL
df$X.2 <- NULL
colnames(df) <- c('map', 'red_score', 'blue_score', 'winner', 'red_1', 'red_2', 'red_3',
                  'red_4', 'red_5', 'blue_1', 'blue_2', 'blue_3', 'blue_4', 'blue_5')
df$winner[df$red_score > df$blue_score] <- 0
df$winner[df$red_score < df$blue_score] <- 1
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'ele'] <- 1
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'engi'] <- 2
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'g'] <- 3
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'mes'] <- 4
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'necro'] <- 5
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'ran'] <- 6
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 't'] <- 7
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'war'] <- 8
```

###The maps
```{r,echo=FALSE}
table(df$map)

qplot(map, data=df, geom="histogram", main = "Histogram of map usage", xlab = "Map", ylab="Count",
      fill=I("blue")) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:4, labels = c("1" = "Kyhlo","2" = "Niflhel", "3" = "Foefire",
                                            "4" = "Silent Storm"))
```

Percentage of maps
```{r,echo=FALSE}
prop.table(table(df$map)) #percentage of map
```

The previous table shows the percentage of map selection for all the four maps available on ranked PvP. The first column is for the Battle of Kyhlo map (12.60%), followed by Forest of Niflhel (44.54%), Legacy of the Foefire (27.73%) and the last column is for Temple of the Silent Storm (15.12%)

##Score and result of the matches
###Overall view of the score and result


Sacar las diferencia entre score del winner y loser (el gap que hay) por mapa
The following table show the frequency of wins for both the red team and the blue team.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
winnerdf <- as.data.frame(table(df$winner))
colnames(winnerdf) <- c("Team", "Frequency")
winnerdf[,1] <- c("Red team", "Blue team")
winnerdf
```
The red team won `r 49/(49+70) * 100`% while the blue team won `r 70 / (49+70) * 100`% of the matches. The percentages of victories per map follows this same pattern. In the map Battle of Kyhlo, the red team won `r 7/(7+8)*100`% of the matches and the blue team won `r 8/(7+8)*100`%, making this the only map where the blue team obtained more victories than the red team. For the next map, Forest of Niflhel, the respective percentages were `r 21/(21+32)*100`% and `r 32/(21+32)*100`, for Legacy of the Foefire `r 11/(11+22)*100` and for Temple of the Silent Storm `r 10/(10+8)*100`% and `r 8/(10+8)*100`%. 

The next table shows this and it is followed by three different plots. The first one presents the frequency of victories of both teams across all the maps, and the others two present the scores of both teams.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wins.per.map <- table(df$map, df$winner)
wins.per.map <- data.frame(map = c('Battle of Kyhlo','Forest of Niflhel',
                                   'Legacy of the Foefire','Temple of the Silent Storm'),
                           red_team = wins.per.map[,1], blue_team = wins.per.map[,2],
                           stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
                                
wins.per.map.percentage <- wins.per.map
wins.per.map.percentage$red.team.win.percent <- wins.per.map$red_team/(wins.per.map$red_team +
                                                                       wins.per.map$blue_team)*100
wins.per.map.percentage$blue.team.win.percent <- wins.per.map$blue_team/(wins.per.map$red_team +
                                                                         wins.per.map$blue_team)*100
wins.per.map.percentage
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}


winners_and_score <- melt(wins.per.map, id='map')
colnames(winners_and_score) <- c('Map', 'Team', 'Frequency')
ggplot(data=winners_and_score, aes(x=Team, y=Frequency, fill=Team))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  facet_wrap(~Map) +
  ggtitle("Scores of both teams per map")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scoresdf <- data.frame(match_number = seq(1,119), red_score = df$red_score, blue_score = df$blue_score, map = df$map)
qplot(match_number, red_score, data = scoresdf, size = red_score, alpha = red_score, colour = "red") + theme(legend.position = "none")
qplot(match_number, blue_score, data = scoresdf, size = blue_score, alpha = blue_score, colour = blue_score) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The next topic to discuss are the scores of the matches. Here, we will take a look at how distributed these scores are and we will show some statistics about them accompanied by several plots. 

####Final scores of the winning team
In this section we will take a look at a summary of the final scores of the winners of all the 
119 matches recorded in this dataset. Before continuining, we would like to mention
that a PvP match in Guild Wars 2 ends when one of the both teams reach a score 
greater or equal to 500.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
winner.score <- pmax(df$red_score, df$blue_score)
summary(winner.score)
```

As expected, the final scores does not vary that much (most of them are close to 500) 
with some them, way over 500 as is the case of the max value of 624; the standard 
deviation of the scores is `r sd(winner.score)`. The reason regarding the score 
of 624 is because one of the maps (Legacy of the Foefire), has an objective that 
gives 150 points to a team.

####Losers score

Unlike the winner's score, the final score of the loser team could be anything from 0 (if you are really bad) up to 499 (in most cases).

The following list shows the scores of the loser's team.

```{r}
loser_score <- pmin(df$red_score, df$blue_score)
loser_score
```

The scores are more varied that the winner scores.

The next table shows a summary of this scores, followed by the standard deviation.

```{r}
summary(loser_score)
print(sd(loser_score))
```

The summary table shows that during one game, the team who lost, just obtained 10 points (ouch!), making this the minimum value across the whole dataset, while the average was 328.2 and the max was 491 (so close to winning). We also calculated the standard deviation, which is `r print(sd(loser_score))`, a value greater than the standard deviation of the winner's score, which was `r print(sd(winner.score))`. The following two figures shows these results via a histogram (that includes a density line) and a boxplot.

```{r}
hist(loser_score, prob=TRUE, col="grey")# prob=TRUE for probabilities not counts
rug(loser_score)
lines(density(loser_score), col="blue", lwd=2) # add a density estimate with defaults
lines(density(loser_score, adjust=2), lty="dotted", col="darkgreen", lwd=2) #smoother
```

The histogram shows that the score of the defeated team during most matches was in the range of 350 to 400 and that there were a few games where the score of the defeated team was less than 100.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(loser_score, main = "Scores of the defeated team", ylab = "Score")
boxplot.stats(loser_score)$out
```

The previous figure, a boxplot, shows the distribution of the scores. The box goes from the first quartile (Q1), which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[2]`  to the third quartile (Q3), `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[4]`. The line in the middle shows the median, which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[3]` and the top and lower whiskers shows the maximum value (excluding the outliers), which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[5]` and the minimum value (also excluding the outliers), which for this dataset is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[1]`. The two dots at the bottom of the plot are the outliers. The values of these two values are 10 and 13.

The next table shows a summary of the boxplot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats
```

The values represent the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum.

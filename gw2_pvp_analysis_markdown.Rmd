##Introduction

##Codebook and dataset
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
setwd("~/Development/R/GW2PvPAnalysis")
df <- read.csv("~/Development/R/GW2PvPAnalysis/GW2_PvP_data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df$X <- NULL
df$X.1 <- NULL
df$X.2 <- NULL
colnames(df) <- c('map', 'red_score', 'blue_score', 'winner', 'red_1', 'red_2', 'red_3',
                  'red_4', 'red_5', 'blue_1', 'blue_2', 'blue_3', 'blue_4', 'blue_5')
df$winner[df$red_score > df$blue_score] <- 0
df$winner[df$red_score < df$blue_score] <- 1
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'ele'] <- 1
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'engi'] <- 2
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'g'] <- 3
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'mes'] <- 4
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'necro'] <- 5
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'ran'] <- 6
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 't'] <- 7
df[5:14][df[5:14] == 'war'] <- 8
```

###The maps
```{r}
table(df$map)

qplot(map, data=df, geom="histogram", main = "Histogram of map usage", xlab = "Map", ylab="Count",
      fill=I("blue")) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:4, labels = c("1" = "Kyhlo","2" = "Niflhel", "3" = "Foefire",
                                            "4" = "Silent Storm"))
```

Percentage of maps
```{r}
prop.table(table(df$map)) #percentage of map
```

The previous table shows the percentage of map selection for all the four maps available on ranked PvP. The first column is for the Battle of Kyhlo map (12.60%), followed by Forest of Niflhel (44.54%), Legacy of the Foefire (27.73%) and the last column is for Temple of the Silent Storm (15.12%)

###The score
The following table show the frequency of wins for both the red team and the blue team.
```{r}
winnerdf <- as.data.frame(table(df$winner))
colnames(winnerdf) <- c("Team", "Frequency")
winnerdf[,1] <- c("Red team", "Blue team")
winnerdf
```
The red team won `r 49/(49+70) * 100`% while the blue team won `r 70 / (49+70) * 100`% of the matches.

The next topic to discuss are the scores of the matches. Here, we will take a look at how distributed these scores were and we will show some statistics about them in addition to some plots. Before continuing, we would like to mention (for those of you who do not know about Guild Wars 2) that a match in GW2 ends when one of the both teams reach a score greater or equal to 500.

####Winner scores
The next list shows the final score of the winning team of all the matches, summary of the data and the standard deviation.

```{r}
winner_score <- pmax(df$red_score, df$blue_score)
summary(winner_score)
print(sd(winner_score))
```

As expected, the final scores does not vary that much (most of them are close to 500) with some them, way over 500 as is the case of the max value of 624. This last remark is because in one of the maps (Legacy of the Foefire), there is an objective that gives 150 points to a team.

####Losers score

Unlike the winner's score, the final score of the loser team could be anything from 0 (if you are really bad) up to 499 (in most cases).

The following list shows the scores of the loser's team.

```{r}
loser_score <- pmin(df$red_score, df$blue_score)
loser_score
```

The scores are more varied that the winner scores.

The next table shows a summary of this scores, followed by the standard deviation.

```{r}
summary(loser_score)
print(sd(loser_score))
```

The summary table shows that during one game, the team who lost, just obtained 10 points (ouch!), making this the minimum value across the whole dataset, while the average was 328.2 and the max was 491 (so close to winning). We also calculated the standard deviation, which is `r print(sd(loser_score))`, a value greater than the standard deviation of the winner's score, which was `r print(sd(winner_score))`. The following two figures shows these results via a histogram (that includes a density line) and a boxplot.

```{r}
hist(loser_score, prob=TRUE, col="grey")# prob=TRUE for probabilities not counts
lines(density(loser_score), col="blue", lwd=2) # add a density estimate with defaults
lines(density(loser_score, adjust=2), lty="dotted", col="darkgreen", lwd=2) #smoother
```

The histogram shows that the score of the defeated team during most matches was in the range of 350 to 400 and that there were a few games where the score of the defeated team was less than 100.

```{r}
boxplot(loser_score)
boxplot.stats(loser_score)$out
```

The previous figure, a boxplot, shows the distribution of the scores. The box goes from the first quartile (Q1), which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[2]`  to the third quartile (Q3), `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[4]`. The line in the middle shows the median, which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[3]` and the top and lower whiskers shows the maximum value (excluding the outliers), which is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[5]` and the minimum value (also excluding the outliers), which for this dataset is `r boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats[1]`. The two dots at the bottom of the plot are the outliers. The values of these two values are 10 and 13.

The next table shows a summary of the boxplot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot.stats(loser_score)$stats
```

The values represent the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum.
